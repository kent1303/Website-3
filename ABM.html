        <h1>What is Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)?</h1>
        <p>Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a simulation modeling technique used to study the interactions of autonomous agents, such as individuals, groups, or organizations, within a specific environment. ABM helps to explore how these interactions lead to the emergence of complex system behaviors.</p>
        
        
            <strong>Key Features of ABM:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Agents operate independently, following specific rules and behaviors.</li>
                <li>Agents interact with each other and their environment.</li>
                <li>The model captures emergent phenomena, revealing patterns and trends.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Use ABM?</h2>
        <p>ABM is valuable for understanding complex systems where individual-level behaviors influence larger system outcomes. It is especially useful when traditional modeling approaches, such as equation-based models, are insufficient for capturing the dynamics of a system.</p>
